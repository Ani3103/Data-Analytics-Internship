# Task Management Dashboard â€“ SQL + Excel Integration

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an **interactive Excel dashboard** developed during my internship at *NoQs Digital*, powered by **SQL-based data extraction and transformation**.

The dashboard provides **real-time task management insights** by combining:
- **SQL** for querying and preparing the data from relational databases.
- **Excel** for creating interactive visualizations and KPI tracking.




## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- **SQL-Powered Data Pipeline:**  
  Extracted task and project data from the companyâ€™s SQL database using custom queries.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation in SQL:**  
  Joins, filtering, aggregation, and calculated columns created at the database level.
- **Dynamic Excel Dashboard:**  
  Interactive charts, KPIs, and pivot tables linked to SQL query outputs.
- **Real-Time Refresh:**  
  Dashboard auto-updates when SQL data source is refreshed.
- **Workload Insights:**  
  Breakdown of tasks by status, assignee, and deadline.



## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Used
- **SQL**  
  - SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and WHERE clauses for data extraction.  
  - Aggregate functions for KPIs (e.g., total tasks completed, overdue tasks).  
  - Subqueries to prepare intermediate datasets.
- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for summarization and visualization.  
  - Conditional Formatting for highlighting key trends.  
  - Slicers and Timeline filters for interactive exploration.
